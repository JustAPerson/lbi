		LBI - Lua Bytecode Interpreter

About:
	LBI is a bytecode interpreter for Lua written in Lua. It aims to allow the
	safe and fast emulation of Lua bytecode where using the standard C 
	facilities for this takes would be dangerous.

Usage:
	Call the function `load_bytecode` which is defined in ./src/main.lua
	It will act like the stdlib function `loadstring` except it only will
	accept Lua bytecode (i.e. strings beginning with '\27')
